# Local Overrides — [YOUR NAME] on [MACHINE NAME]

<!--
  This file is CLAUDE.local.md — your personal, machine-specific overrides.

  HOW IT WORKS
  - Claude Code reads this automatically at the start of every session.
  - It takes HIGHEST precedence — it overrides anything in CLAUDE.md.
  - It is automatically gitignored. Never committed. Yours alone.

  SETUP
  Copy this file: cp CLAUDE.local.md.example CLAUDE.local.md
  Then fill in anything that differs from the shared CLAUDE.md defaults.
  Delete sections you don't need.

## Local Environment

```bash
# Override the dev server port if yours differs
# DEV_PORT=4000

# Local database (override the shared .env default)
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://tom@localhost/myproject_dev

# Local test database
# TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://tom@localhost/myproject_test

# Any machine-specific API keys for local dev/testing only
# THIRD_PARTY_API_KEY=sk-local-...
```

---

## Local Run Commands

<!-- Override only the commands that differ on this machine -->

```bash
# Install
# pnpm install   # if you use pnpm instead of npm

# Dev server
# make dev       # if you prefer make targets

# Tests
# ./scripts/test-local.sh   # if you have a local wrapper
```

## Personal Preferences

<!--
  Preferences that apply to how YOU work — not the whole team.
  Examples: preferred agent behavior, verbosity, output style.
-->

- Prefer shorter commit message bodies — bullet points only, no prose
- Always confirm before running database migrations, even in dev
- When suggesting variable names, prefer verbose over terse

---

## Machine-Specific Gotchas

<!--
  Things that bite you on THIS machine that don't apply to teammates.
-->

- Node version managed by `fnm` — run `fnm use` before `npm install` or commands will use wrong version
- Docker Desktop tends to hog memory — restart it if builds hang
- `/tmp` is on a RAM disk here — don't write large test fixtures there

---

## Local Off-Limits

<!--
  Additional rules that apply on THIS machine only.
  These are in addition to the Off Limits section in CLAUDE.md.
-->

- Do NOT restart the local Docker daemon — other projects depend on it
